# Netflix_NLP_project
We chose to apply different NLP techniques(Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) for sentimental analysis in reviews. The data set for analysis is extracted from "Netflix Reviews [DAILY UPDATED]" on Kaggle, which was updated on 3/13/2025.
We can select the best NLP techniques and features to predict review sentiments based on our results.
